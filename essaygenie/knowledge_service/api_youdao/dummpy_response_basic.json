        "rawEssay": "Nowadays, more and more middle-aged people are suffering from insomnia, as life for the middle-aged is stressful indeed. For one thing, as they are the backbones of their companies, they have plenty of things to do at work. And they usually have to work overtime. For another, they have to take great responsibilities at home, for their aged parents need to be supported and their little children need to be brought up. That's why they don't have enough time to have a good rest. To sleep well, some of them often take sleeping pills. I don't think it's good for them to do so, because the sleeping pills can only get rid of the sign of insomnia, not the cause. And taking too much sleeping pills is bad for their health. Therefore, I suggest those middle-aged people should know how to relax themselves and rest their brains. Taking a simple walk after supper will be beneficial for them. Besides, they can have a glass of milk before going to bed, which can be helpful for their sleep.",
