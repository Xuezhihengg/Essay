    "ModelContent": "Dear Tom,I’m delighted to hear that you’re interested in Chinese traditional festivals. Among them, the Spring Festival is the most important and meaningful one for us.The Spring Festival usually falls in late January or early February, marking the start of a new lunar year. It’s a time for family reunions and expressing our hopes for happiness and prosperity in the coming year. During the festival, we clean our houses to sweep away bad luck, decorate them with red couplets, and prepare delicious meals. On New Year’s Eve, families gather for a big dinner, followed by watching the Spring Festival Gala and setting off fireworks. Children are especially excited to receive red envelopes with money inside.For me, the Spring Festival is not only a celebration but also a chance to reconnect with my family and traditions. I feel proud of our rich culture and enjoy the warmth of this special time.I hope you can visit China during the Spring Festival someday. It would be a wonderful experience!Best wishes,Li Hua",
