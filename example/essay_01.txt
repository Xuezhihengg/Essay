Stress is a state of being upset that happens when we are under presure. Both our feeling and our bodies gets upset. We can even get emotionally and physically sicked if we have too much stress for too long.

Stress can come at us from every direction. For instence, it can come from fights with other people. It can come when we have too many things to do and too little time to do it. It can also come when we do not have enough money to pay for what we want.

Since stress can make us sicking, we have to learn how to deal with it. There are good ways and bad ways to do so. We should deal with stress in good ways, of course. Good ways to cut down on stress include change our lifestyle. For example, we can learn either to get alongs with people or stay away from them. We can decide what to do now, what to do later, and what to leave off doing forever. We can also figure out how to get money or cutting down on what we want.

We should not deal with stress in bad ways because bad ways to cut down on stress just lead to more troubles, for example, skip out and leave our work undone, blames our problem on someone else, steling or cheating.
